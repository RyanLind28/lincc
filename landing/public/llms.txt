# Lincc

> Lincc is a local events and discovery platform. Everything happening around you — events, deals, openings, offers — all live, all local. Think of it as your local pulse.

## What is Lincc?

Lincc is a real-time local discovery app that shows you everything happening nearby — events, deals, openings, meetups, and more — in chronological order with no algorithmic filtering. Unlike social media platforms that decide what you see, Lincc shows everything in the order it was posted, so you never miss what's happening around you.
