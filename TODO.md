# LINCC TODO

## Backlog

- **Verify Sentry DSN is set in Vercel** — `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is set locally in `.env.local` but is not listed among the Vercel env vars in CLAUDE.md. If it's missing, every `Sentry.captureException` call (including the new ones added 2026-05-01 for image uploads, account deletion, Samsung browser triage) is a silent no-op in production. Check Vercel → lincc project → Settings → Environment Variables for `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. If absent, copy the value from `.env.local` and add for Production + Preview, then redeploy. If you don't have a Sentry account at all, sign up at sentry.io (free tier covers current scale), create a React project, copy the DSN, and add it to both `.env.local` and Vercel.

## Session Changelog — 2026-04-29

Massive day. Architecture-level shifts plus polish. ~50 items closed, 5 migrations applied (043 → 049). All TypeScript clean.

### Account model rewrite — Personal vs Business
- **Account types as a first-class concept** (migration 045) — `profiles.account_type` (`'personal' | 'business'`), drop deprecated `is_business` + `business_*` columns from profiles, businesses now a sibling entity (one per owner), pre-existing live businesses auto-approved
- **Business approval workflow** — `businesses.status` enum extended to `pending_approval | approved | rejected | suspended | inactive | archived`; `rejection_reason`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by` columns
- **Signup chooser** — two-card Personal / Business picker on `SignupPage`. Business path collects contact name, business name, category. `handle_new_user` trigger now creates the linked `businesses` row with auto-generated unique slug
- **PendingApprovalPage** with re-submit on rejection
- **Soft-gate**: pending business accounts roam the app freely (no redirect lock-in) with a persistent `BusinessApprovalBanner`. Publishing is blocked at the DB level via `events_publish_gate` and `vouchers_publish_gate` BEFORE INSERT triggers
- **Friendly Create Event / Create Voucher gates** when business is unapproved (CTA → `/business/verify`)
- **Admin business applications page** (`/admin/business-applications`) with reason filter, audit log, owner notifications

### Business verification (blue tick)
- **Migration 047** adds `business_verifications` table (4 doc paths + status + reviewer notes) and `businesses.verified` + `verified_at`
- **Private storage bucket** `business-verification-docs` with RLS (owner read+write own folder; admin read all)
- **`/business/verify` page** with 4 doc upload slots (operator selfie, ID document, selfie with ID, business registration), live preview via signed URLs, status banner, re-submit on rejection
- **Admin doc review** — thumbnails of submitted docs in the applications queue (signed URLs); "Approve & verify" auto-flips `verified=true` when verification submitted
- **`<VerifiedTick />`** badge rendered next to business name on BusinessPage, BusinessDashboard, EventCard, EventDetailPage, VoucherDetailPage

### Bidirectional reviews + dispute flow
- **Migration 044** — renamed `event_reviews` → `host_reviews`; new columns `host_rating` + `event_rating` + `host_reply` + `is_disputed`; new `guest_reviews` table for host-rates-guest; reports gain `host_review_id` + `guest_review_id`
- **`review_prompt` notification type** — fires on event expiry (cron + trigger) for each approved guest and the host
- **Uber-style auto-prompt modal** on HomePage walks the user through pending reviews; "Skip for now" (sessionStorage) and "Don't ask again" (localStorage)
- **EventReviewsSection** on detail pages — split into `HostReviewsList` + `GuestReviewsList`, each with reply + dispute flows
- **`<RatingBadges />`** on UserProfilePage shows host avg + guest avg with counts
- Dispute → admin reports queue with full review context + Approve/Reject (with reason)

### Chat reporting + admin moderation toolkit
- **Migration 049** — `reports.message_id` + `reports.dm_message_id` FKs (cascade)
- **Flag pill on every non-own message** in event chat + DMs → opens `<ReportMessageDialog />` with chat-tailored reasons (harassment / inappropriate / spam / hate / safety / other) + message preview
- **Admin reports modal** now surfaces chat context with deep links (Open thread →, Open conversation →)
- **Real moderation actions** in the admin Reports modal: **Warn** (notification), **Suspend** (with duration), **Ban**, **Delete message**, **Remove from event**, **Cancel event** — every action writes to `admin_audit_log` and notifies the user

### Subcategories + categories
- **Subcategory schema seeded** — `categories.parent_id` self-reference + 69 subcategories backfilled from the static frontend list
- **Admin Categories page rewritten** as expandable parent → child tree, add-subcategory inline button per parent, parent dropdown in the modal, cascade delete
- **Subcategory unique constraint** — partial unique on `(parent_id, name)` so siblings under different parents can share names
- Fixed render bug where icon **name** displayed next to category name (looked like duplicates)

### Admin panel polish
- **Dashboard tile-grid** for Manage moved front and centre with count badges (pending applications, pending verifications, pending reports, flagged users, flagged events)
- **Activity feed** — paginated (8/page from a 60-pool) with click-through to the right detail page (user / event / report)
- **Desktop-friendly layout**: 4-col stat cards, side-by-side charts, 3-col top-lists
- **All admin sub-pages** capped to sensible widths (`max-w-7xl` for lists, smaller for detail/forms)
- **Admin link** added to Settings → Developer
- **Admin SELECT policy on businesses** — pending applications now actually appear in the queue (was hidden by RLS)
- **Notifications**: `business_approved` / `business_rejected` types added with icons + path

### Public business profile + dashboard
- **BusinessPage redesigned** — cover hero (blurred logo + gradient), floating logo card, name + verified tick + ★ rating + open-now status, stats strip (Events / Vouchers / Locations / Reviews), grids for what's-on + deals, locations + hours grid, **socials block** (website / IG / FB / X / TikTok / LinkedIn / YouTube / WhatsApp / phone / email), public reviews carousel, past events
- **BusinessDashboardPage** rewritten with hero, performance stats (active events, vouchers, redemptions, avg rating), quick actions, tabbed sections (Overview, Events, Vouchers, Locations, Reviews, Profile)
- **Business slug URLs** — `/business/dannys-maths-hub` works alongside `/business/<uuid>` (UUID-or-slug fetcher)
- **Calendar-style EventTile** + fluid voucher cards (image-left, progress bar)
- **Operator-by attribution removed** from public business pages (businesses are self-contained)
- **Edit business page** uses `PlacesAutocomplete` for the address now
- Migration adds `businesses.social_links jsonb`

### Voucher detail
- **Hero with discount badge + category chip overlay**, title + description
- **Status chips** — expiring soon / almost gone / 1-per-customer / business offer
- **"Offered by" business card** with verified tick + category
- **"You save" card** computed from original/discounted prices with % off
- **Stock availability bar** (claimed / limit + "X still available")
- **Quick facts grid**, **Where to redeem** (primary venue + every business location, all open Google Maps)
- **More from <Business>** carousel of other live vouchers

### Personal profile redesign
- **Cover band + floating avatar + identity row** mirrors the business page exactly
- **Stats strip** — Followers / Following / Hosted / Joined
- **Status chips** for Early access, Ghost mode, Women-only
- **Share button** in the header (native share / clipboard fallback)
- Personal-page-only — business accounts redirected to their dashboard
- **`<InstallAppCard />`** mounted on profile — uses `BeforeInstallPrompt` on Android/Chrome/Edge, falls back to manual "Add to Home Screen" instructions on iOS Safari, dismissable per-device

### Profile photo upload
- **Avatar cropper** (round + square crops via `react-easy-crop`) with drag-to-position + zoom slider
- **HEIC detection** with explicit error message ("iPhone HEIC photos aren't supported, switch to Most Compatible…")
- **Magic-byte validation** (was only size before)
- **Specific Supabase error messages** surfaced (was always generic "Failed to upload")
- **Upload-then-delete** instead of delete-then-upload — no more lost avatars on failed uploads

### Theme + Safari chrome
- **Dark mode bug fixed app-wide** — `--color-muted` token added; swept ~30 hardcoded `bg-gray-200/300` across skeletons, avatars, toggles, dots, drag handles, etc. → `bg-muted`
- **Dark class applied at app boot** (`main.tsx`) instead of only when SettingsPage mounted
- **`color-scheme: dark`** on `html.dark` so native form controls + scrollbars match
- **Safari "big bars" fixed** — `theme-color` now matches the page bg (`#FAFAFA` light, `#0F0F1A` dark) via media-query meta tags; `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style: black-translucent`; manifest theme/background colors aligned; in-app dark mode toggle re-paints theme-color at runtime

### Plumbing
- **Google Analytics 4** integrated — measurement id `G-8NHZY93N9K`, env-gated (no-op without var), SPA route tracking, `user_id` stitching after sign-in
- **Cookie consent banner** — bottom-of-screen Accept / Decline; GA only loads after Accept; localStorage-persisted decision
- **Update prompt redesigned** — full-screen non-dismissable overlay (was a toast). Mounted at App root so it covers chats, landing, etc.
- **Persistent SideNav across full-screen routes** — chat, create event, create voucher, business dashboard, etc., now keep the desktop sidebar (was disappearing). MainLayout split `showSideNav` from `showBottomNav`
- **Vouchers tab** in desktop side nav (was missing); side nav icons left-aligned when expanded

### Misc UI
- **Em-dashes removed** from PendingApprovalPage UI strings (per memory)
- **App-wide full-width desktop layouts** — list pages drop `max-w-5xl` caps so content fills the room next to the sidebar
- **Larger event grids on `xl`** — MyEvents, Vouchers, Saved
- **Profile page** drops "My Businesses" link, redirects business accounts to dashboard

### Data fixes
- Spread Danny's Maths-Hub demo data: 3 locations, 4 vouchers (incl. "30-min free intro lesson"), 3 events + reviews + redemptions
- Reset Ryan's account back to personal; deleted +1/+2/lindustries test users; deleted orphan Ryan's Cafe business
- All 22 active events spread across `now → +13 days` so the home feed is populated within the 14-day visibility window

### Migrations applied today
- `043_host_reviews_and_disputes` — host reviews + dispute trigger + reports.review_id
- `044_bidirectional_reviews` — host_reviews / guest_reviews split + review_prompt notifications
- `045_account_types_and_approval` — profiles.account_type, business approval workflow, publish gates
- `047_business_verifications` — verifications table + private storage bucket + RLS
- `049_chat_reports` — reports.message_id + dm_message_id (FKs cascade)
- Plus several smaller policy / index / seed migrations (admin RLS on businesses; `business_categories`; subcategories backfill; cascade on `categories.parent_id`; `businesses.social_links`; `businesses.verified` + `verified_at`; `categories.kind` plus seeded business categories)

## Session Changelog — 2026-04-17

Big push day. ~25 items closed end-to-end. Details inline below — this is the headline list for reviewers.

### Auth & Signup
- **Duplicate signup with same email** — detected via Supabase's empty `identities[]` anti-enumeration signal; user is redirected to `/login?email=...` (prefilled)
- **First-time login fails after email confirm** — removed the aggressive `email_confirmed_at` sign-out check (JWT doesn't carry that field, so the check was spuriously signing people out who'd just confirmed)
- **Resend confirmation button** on the verify-email screen with 60s cooldown + spam-folder hint
- **Two-checkbox signup consent** (T&C + 18+) — migration 036 copies consent into profile via `handle_new_user` trigger so the /terms page is skipped
- **Profile picture optional in onboarding** — `checkProfileComplete` no longer requires avatar; default initial-based Avatar handles `src={null}`
- **OAuth Google button wired** (waiting on Supabase Dashboard credentials to activate)
- **Google OAuth activated** (2026-04-18) — Google Cloud project `lincc-prod`, OAuth client "Lincc Web", consent screen published with `lincc.live` as authorised domain. Redirect URI: `https://srrubyupwiiqnehshszd.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. JS origins: localhost:5173, lincc.live, lincc-six.vercel.app. Pasted Client ID + Secret into Supabase and enabled the provider. See Known Limitations for the consent-screen branding note.

### Events & Discovery
- **Duplicate event** action on EventDetailPage — writes event data to `sessionStorage` and navigates to `/event/new` pre-filled
- **Save as Draft** on CreateEventPage — migration 037 adds `'draft'` to `event_status` enum; new Drafts tab on MyEventsPage with Publish/Delete
- **14-day upcoming-window filter** on home feed, map, search, explore — hides stale 2027 seed events while leaving real user events visible (was 24h/7d at first)
- **Hide expired events** on MyEventsPage and SavedEventsPage (filter: `status ∈ ('active','full') AND expires_at ≥ now`)
- **Past events toggle** on profile page with Upcoming/Past pill (both full-width)
- **Business events show business name + logo** — joined `business:businesses!business_id(*)` across queries, new `business` field on EventWithDetails/ScoredEvent

### Chat
- **Past-event chats filtered** per PRD rule (`expires_at >= now - 24h`)
- **Chat archive countdown** — new `<ChatStatusPill>` shows "Live now" / "Archives in 23h 45m" etc. on both chat list rows and in the chat room banner, ticking every 30s via `useNow` hook
- **Chat row UI polish** — event cover image replaces gradient icon when available; larger avatars for Friends tab

### UI / Navigation
- **Bottom nav rewrite** — scrapped the broken SVG-gradient-stroke trick that made icons invisible; now solid coral/muted with labels under each icon. Map/globe toggle icon no longer disappears on map view.
- **Vouchers tab** added to bottom nav + new `/vouchers` page with grid, search, category filter
- **Profile menu moved** from Header `rightContent` into the profile card itself (Follow / Message / Share / More⋮ row)
- **Header logo always visible** and clickable as full-width home link (no more overlap with action buttons)
- **EventCardMini polished** — 64x64 cover image, coral time, venue with pin, "X/Y going" — consistent with chat rows
- **MyEventsPage EventRow** redesigned to match EventCardMini
- **Duplicate/Chat/Manage buttons** on event detail — no more 2-line text wrap
- **Profile page avatar action** — Follow/Message/Share/More moved inline, separator dots added

### Social / Discovery
- **Find People suggestions** — migration 039/040 `suggest_users()` SECURITY DEFINER function does friends-of-friends with popular-users fallback for sparse graphs. Reusable `<FollowButton>` with optimistic UI.
- **Waitlist badge** — "Early access member" sparkle pill on ProfilePage for users whose email is in the waitlist. Migration 038 adds RLS so users can read their own waitlist row.

### Bugs
- **Directions link** on event detail — was `maps/place/` (shows place), now `maps/dir/?api=1&destination=...` (actual turn-by-turn)
- **Find My Location** on MapView — was failing silently; now shows toast with the specific reason (permission denied / timeout / etc.) + 10s timeout
- **Pull-to-refresh** extended to ChatsPage
- **Support email unified** to `hello@lincc.live` across app, landing, email templates

### Email infrastructure
- **Custom SMTP live via Resend** — sender: `Lincc <noreply@system.lincc.live>`, domain verified
- **15 Lincc-branded email templates**: confirm-signup, magic-link, reset-password, change-email, invite, reauthentication (auth), password-changed, email-changed, phone-changed, identity-linked, identity-unlinked, mfa-added, mfa-removed (security), waitlist-confirmation + welcome (custom)
- **Welcome email on signup** — new `send-welcome-email` Edge Function fires once per user after email confirmation (client-triggered, idempotent via `profiles.welcomed_at`). Matches approved copy.
- **Styled HTML text logo** (Lincc in coral+purple) replaces WEBP image for reliable rendering across Outlook / Apple Mail / privacy clients
- **README.md** in `supabase/email-templates/` documents file → Dashboard slot mapping
- **Waitlist confirmation Edge Function** (`send-waitlist-email`) ready — uses Resend + inlined template; needs deploy via `supabase functions deploy send-waitlist-email --no-verify-jwt`

### Migrations applied today
- `036_signup_consent` — `handle_new_user` trigger copies T&C + 18+ consent from user metadata into profile
- `037_event_drafts` — adds `'draft'` to `event_status` enum
- `038_waitlist_user_self_read` — RLS so users can read their own waitlist row
- `039_suggest_users` — friends-of-friends SECURITY DEFINER function
- `040_suggest_users_fallback` — adds popular-users fallback when friends-of-friends is empty
- `041_welcomed_at` — `profiles.welcomed_at` column for welcome-email dedupe

### Still needs dashboard paste (you, before testers)
- Paste the 13 auth/security email templates from `supabase/email-templates/*.html` into Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email Templates (matches README.md mapping)
- Set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM=Lincc <noreply@system.lincc.live>` in Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets
- Deploy both custom Edge Functions:
  - `supabase functions deploy send-waitlist-email --no-verify-jwt`
  - `supabase functions deploy send-welcome-email` (requires JWT — do NOT add `--no-verify-jwt`)
- OAuth Google — Google Cloud Console client + Supabase Dashboard provider credentials

- [ ] Feature request form — in-app form logged to DB
- [ ] Contact us form — in-app support form
- [ ] Manage cookies / revoke consent UI in Settings (currently first-prompt only)

## Blocked / Waiting

_(Nothing currently blocked)_

---

## Known Limitations

- Supabase: `spatial_ref_sys` RLS — PostGIS system table, known platform limitation
- Supabase: PostGIS in public schema — safe to ignore, moving risks breaking geo queries
- Supabase: Enable leaked password protection — Dashboard > Auth > Attack Protection (manual step)
- ~~Google Places API key not set~~ — **Fixed**: Key added to `.env.local` and Vercel env vars
- Google OAuth consent screen shows `srrubyupwiiqnehshszd.supabase.co` instead of `lincc.live` — Google derives this from the redirect URI domain, not the consent-screen app name. Fix requires a Supabase custom auth domain (e.g. `auth.lincc.live`), which is a Pro plan add-on ($10/mo). Revisit once on Pro: Dashboard → Custom Domains → add `auth.lincc.live`, add CNAME at DNS, then update the authorised redirect URI in Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Lincc Web. Cosmetic only — sign-in works fine in the meantime.

---

## Open Bugs

### From tester feedback (2026-04-15 — Tami & Ahsan)
- [x] Duplicate signup with same email allowed — **Fixed**: Supabase returns success with empty `identities[]` when email is already registered (anti-enumeration behavior). `signUp` in AuthContext now detects this and returns `{ alreadyExists: true }`. SignupPage shows a toast and redirects to `/login?email=...` with email prefilled.
- [x] Confirmation email sometimes not delivered — **Partially fixed**: Added "Resend confirmation email" button with 60s cooldown on the verification-sent screen + spam folder hint. `resendConfirmation()` in AuthContext uses `supabase.auth.resend({ type: 'signup', email })`. **Remaining (dashboard-only)**: Configure custom SMTP (e.g. Resend/SendGrid/Postmark) in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → SMTP Settings. The default shared SMTP has ~2-4 emails/hour rate limits, which is likely why testers who signed up in a short burst didn't all receive emails.
- [x] First-time login fails, requires 2–3 attempts — **Fixed**: Root cause was the aggressive `email_confirmed_at` sign-out check in `AuthContext.onAuthStateChange`. When a user clicked the confirm-email link, we manually exchanged the hash tokens via `setSession()`, but that only decodes the JWT — which doesn't contain `email_confirmed_at`. The listener saw a falsy value and signed them out. Supabase already enforces confirmation at `signInWithPassword` server-side, so the client check was both redundant and actively broken. Removed it.
- [x] Signup email branded "Supabase" instead of Lincc — **Diagnosed (dashboard-only fix required)**: All four local templates in `supabase/email-templates/` (confirm-signup, magic-link, reset-password, change-email) are Lincc-branded. The "Supabase" branding testers see is the **sender identity** — by default Supabase Auth sends from `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io` with sender name "Supabase Auth". Configuring custom SMTP (same step needed for Bug #3 above) resolves this. Also verify that all four template bodies in Dashboard → Auth → Email Templates match the files in `supabase/email-templates/` (dashboard edits don't sync from the repo).
- [x] Profile picture forced in onboarding — **Fixed**: Dropped `avatar_url` from `checkProfileComplete` (AuthContext) so it's no longer required to exit onboarding. Avatar step on OnboardingPage updated with "Optional — you can always add one later" copy and no longer blocks the Continue button. Users who skip get the default initial-based Avatar (which already handles `src={null}`).
- [x] "Add to home screen" / install prompt not surfaced during signup — **Fixed**: Added iOS Safari fallback instructions in onboarding step 5 (Share → Add to Home Screen) since `beforeinstallprompt` never fires on iOS.
- [x] Follow button formatting broken on user profile page — **Fixed**: Changed from `flex-1` (stretched) to natural width `px-5`, hid "Message" text on small screens (icon-only), grouped Share+More with `ml-auto`.
- [x] Chat bar formatting broken when messaging someone — **Fixed**: Changed `h-screen` to `h-dvh` on DMChatRoomPage + ChatRoomPage for proper mobile viewport handling. Added `overflow-hidden` and `overscrollBehavior: contain` for iOS keyboard.
- [x] Map/globe toggle button unclear — **Fixed**: Stable "Discover" label + context-appropriate icons (Compass in list view, Map in map view). No more confusing label/icon swap.
- [x] Map toggle icon disappears on map view + Lincc logo doesn't link home — **Fixed**: Part of the toggle rewrite above. Logo was already a `<Link to="/">` (no-op on home page is correct behavior).
- [x] Bottom-nav Chats shows empty list but event-initiated chats have messages — **Fixed**: Rewrote `getUserChats` in chatService to avoid circular nested join (event_participants → events → event_participants). Now uses simple two-step query: get participant event IDs, then query events directly with OR filter.
- [x] Directions / "find my location" not working — **Fixed**: (a) `EventDetailPage` Directions link was using `maps/place/?q=place_id:...` which just shows the place — swapped to the proper directions deep link `maps/dir/?api=1&destination=lat,lng&destination_place_id=...` which opens Google Maps with turn-by-turn on web/iOS/Android. (b) `MapView.handleFindMe` was silently failing on permission-denied / timeout — added clear toast messages ("Location access denied", "Location unavailable", etc.) and bumped the geolocation timeout from 5s → 10s with a 60s cache.

- [x] Magic link login broken — **Fixed**: Added explicit `getSession()` bootstrap after auth listener setup to catch hash token exchange that completes before listener is ready. Also handle `INITIAL_SESSION` event alongside `SIGNED_IN`. Added `TOKEN_REFRESHED` handling to avoid resetting profile/loading state. Added profile fetch retry (1s delay) for transient DB failures.
- [x] Unable to add venue — **Fixed**: Rewrote placesService.ts to use Google Maps JavaScript SDK instead of REST API (which was blocked by CORS)
- [x] Unable to join events — **Fixed**: Added missing DELETE RLS policy on event_participants (migration 023). JOIN INSERT was working, but leave/cancel was silently failing.
- [x] List/map toggle icon disappears when switching — **Fixed**: Bumped BottomNav z-index from z-40 to z-50 to prevent MapView stacking context from obscuring it
- [x] Notifications not configured — **Fixed**: Generated new VAPID key pair, set all 4 edge function secrets via Management API, disabled JWT verification on edge function. **Remaining**: Update `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` in Vercel env vars to `BAu2e1J1983rUKz8Dk2qWB5GO0UJerC3qCZiEmj3HuPFwW-xO7-j8CsljNiIWZxsbFe-rct-rkmMrkfHfzrJPTA`
- [x] Enable notifications banner cut off on laptop — **Fixed**: Added `lg:max-w-xl lg:mx-auto` to constrain width on desktop
- [x] Email/password login returns "invalid credentials" — **Fixed**: Added `required` to password field, improved error messages to suggest Magic Link as fallback
- [x] PWA desktop install prompt not appearing — **Fixed**: Changed from permanent dismissal to 7-day time-based dismissal so prompt re-appears
- [x] Adding profile picture resets onboarding — **Fixed**: Guarded `isProfileComplete` redirect to only fire on initial mount (step 1, no avatar), not during active onboarding
- [x] Adding event cover image resets to categories — **Fixed**: Persisted create-event form state in sessionStorage so it survives file-picker remounts (mobile browsers drop the tab from memory when the OS picker opens)
- [x] Dark mode skip button not visible — **Fixed**: Increased dark mode `text-muted`/`text-light` contrast, fixed `gradient-border` and GradientButton outline variant to use `bg-surface` instead of hardcoded white

## Backlog (New Feature Requests)

- [x] Save event as draft — **Fixed**: Migration 037 adds `'draft'` to the `event_status` enum. Existing RLS already restricts visibility (host-only for non-`'active'` statuses; feed queries filter by `status='active'`; `expire_past_events()` cron only touches active rows so drafts never expire). `CreateEventPage` now has a "Save as Draft" button on the final step. New `MyEventsPage` "Drafts" tab lists the user's drafts with Publish (→ `status='active'`) and Delete actions. Auto-save of in-progress form was already implemented via `sessionStorage` under key `lincc-create-event-draft`.
- [x] PWA install screen in onboarding — iOS fallback instructions added to step 5; native `beforeinstallprompt` already handled
- [x] Search by postcode — **Fixed**: Typing a UK postcode or place name in the search bar geocodes via Mapbox and filters events around that location. Coral pill shows custom location with X to clear back to GPS.
- [ ] Header logo resolution — replace current @4x webp with higher-res source file and scale down for crisp rendering
- [x] Dark mode colour audit — **Fixed**: Replaced hardcoded grays (`bg-gray-50/100`, `hover:bg-gray-50`, `border-gray-200`) with semantic tokens (`bg-background`, `border-border`) across 38 files
- [x] OAuth login — Facebook removed permanently (per product call); Google live, Apple out of scope
- [x] Analytics — Google Analytics 4 (`G-8NHZY93N9K`) live with consent-gated cookie banner, SPA route tracking, signed-in user_id stitching
- [x] Desktop UI/UX improvements — full-width consumer pages, persistent SideNav across full-screen routes, business / profile / voucher hero redesigns, larger grids on `xl`
- [x] Business events posted under business identity — handled by the new account-type model: business accounts always post under `business_id`, BEFORE INSERT trigger blocks personal accounts from setting business_id, EventCard / EventDetailPage / VoucherDetailPage all show business name + logo + verified tick when `business_id` is set
- [x] Main filter — single category select only. **Fixed**: Changed to radio-style single-select on HomePage FilterPills and BottomSheet category grid. Tapping selected category deselects (shows all).
- [x] Removed / left event notifications — **Fixed**: Added `participant_removed`, `participant_left`, `participant_rejoined` notification types. Triggers fire in participantService on reject/leave/rejoin.
- [x] Guest list visibility rules — **Fixed**: Host sees full list (names + avatars + profile links). Participants see avatar stack + count only. Non-participants see count text only.
- [x] iOS "Add to Home Screen" entry in Settings — **Fixed**: Added conditional row in About section that renders on iOS Safari (non-standalone) with Share → Add to Home Screen instructions.
- [x] Event images — **Fixed**: Removed user upload from CreateEventPage. Cover auto-populates from Google Places venue photo or category stock image. Venue photo carousel retained for picking between photos.
- [x] Dark mode persistence + UI audit — **Fixed**: (a) localStorage persistence with try-catch in useDarkMode hook. (b) Full audit of 38 files replacing hardcoded grays with semantic tokens.
- [x] Chat viewport behaviour — **Fixed**: `h-dvh` + `overflow-hidden` on root, `overscrollBehavior: contain` on messages area. Header and input stay pinned.
- [x] Settings icon on every main page — **Fixed**: Added settings gear `rightContent` to Header on HomePage, ChatsPage, MyEventsPage, VouchersPage.
- [x] Google OAuth prefill — **Fixed**: OnboardingPage reads `user.user_metadata` from Google OAuth payload and prefills `first_name` and `avatar_url` (name split + avatar). DOB and gender remain manual (not in standard Google scopes).

### From tester feedback (2026-04-15 — Tami)
- [x] Remove old demo/test events — **Re-scoped & fixed**: User confirmed they didn't want to delete from DB — the real ask was that the UI shouldn't show expired events. Audited every event query: home feed, map, search, explore, user profile, and event detail were already filtering correctly. The two surfaces that were still showing expired events were `MyEventsPage` (Hosting + Joined tabs) and `SavedEventsPage`. Both now filter to `status ∈ ('active','full')` and `expires_at >= now`. DB rows are left intact (hosts could see their own past events via a future "history" tab, and cascade-delete of 37 rows wasn't worth the risk).
- [x] Waitlist confirmation email + in-app flow — **Scaffolded (ready; needs Resend API key)**:
  - New Edge Function `supabase/functions/send-waitlist-email/index.ts` — sends a branded Lincc-styled HTML email via Resend. Reads `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` (default `Lincc <hello@lincc.live>`), and optional `WAITLIST_FUNCTION_SECRET` from Edge Function secrets.
  - New template `supabase/email-templates/waitlist-confirmation.html` (reference copy — the function has the HTML inlined so it can deploy without external fetches).
  - Both waitlist entry points now fire-and-forget POST to the edge function after a successful insert: React `WaitlistForm` in `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` and the static `landing/index.html` form. If the function isn't deployed or the key isn't set, the insert still succeeds — no UX regression.
  - Migration `038` adds a RLS SELECT policy so a signed-in user can read their own waitlist row (by `auth.email()`), without exposing the whole table.
  - New `useWaitlistStatus` hook (`src/hooks/useWaitlistStatus.ts`) + "Early access member" sparkle badge on `ProfilePage` shown for users whose email is on the waitlist.
  - **Setup required (dashboard-only)**: in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets, set `RESEND_API_KEY` (from https://resend.com). Then `supabase functions deploy send-waitlist-email --no-verify-jwt`.
- [ ] Category icon render audit — fix design/state/colour render issues on category icons across the app (home, explore, event cards). **Blocked**: user will supply replacement SVG icons directly (their SVG editor is broken). Reopen when assets are provided.
- [ ] Verify push + "add to desktop" notifications end-to-end — confirm both desktop install notification and push notifications actually fire and land on device for a real user (not just config)
- [x] Business profile display fixes — **Fixed**:
  - Events posted by a business now display the **business name + logo** instead of the individual host's name. Updated `EventDetailPage` (both "Hosted by" card and queries join `business:businesses!business_id(*)`), `EventCard`, `EventCardGrid`, `recommendationService`, `eventService.fetchEvents`, and `transformers.ts`/`ScoredEvent` type to carry business info through the recommendation pipeline.
  - Business categories already render correctly from the DB categories table (verified).
  - Cover photo upload already existed on `CreateVoucherPage` and `CreateEventPage`. Improved the label on CreateVoucherPage: "Cover photo" with helper text "Upload a photo of the product or venue. Optional, but recommended." so businesses can tell they can use product shots.
  - BusinessPage already renders the business name correctly.
- [x] Duplicate event option — **Fixed**: Added Copy icon button in the host action overlay on `EventDetailPage`. Writes event data to `sessionStorage` under the existing `lincc-create-event-draft` key (re-using the draft system) and navigates to `/event/new`. Pre-fills category, title, description, venue, date/time, capacity, join mode, audience, allow_dms, and cover image. Subcategory is skipped (not stored on events). Host-only — can open up to all users later if requested.
- [x] Change support email to `hello@lincc.live` — **Fixed**: Replaced all customer-facing email addresses across the app and landing with `hello@lincc.live`. Updated: `src/pages/landing/ContactPage.tsx`, `src/pages/landing/PrivacyPage.tsx`, `src/pages/landing/TermsPage.tsx`, `landing/contact.html`, `landing/privacy.html`, `landing/terms.html`. Previously had split addresses (`hello@`, `privacy@`, `legal@` all on `@lincc.app`) — all consolidated to `hello@lincc.live`. _Still needs confirmation from Tami on `.com` vs `.live` — used `.com` per direct request._ Email templates in `supabase/email-templates/` don't reference a from address (set in Dashboard SMTP config).
- [x] Split signup consent into two checkboxes — **Fixed**: SignupPage now has two separate checkboxes (T&C with link to `/landing/terms`, 18+ confirmation). Both required to submit; "Create Account" button disabled until both checked. Consent passed via `supabase.auth.signUp` options.data → migration 036 updates the `handle_new_user` trigger to copy `terms_accepted_at` and `is_business` from user metadata into the profile row, so the post-signup /terms page is skipped for consenting users.
